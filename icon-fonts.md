# Working With Icon Fonts

The purpose of this talk is to explore icon fonts and how they are beneficial.

### PROS

- Performance: single font file / HTTP request
- Aesthetics: vectors instead of raster images
- Cross-browser Compatibility: all web browsers including IE have the ability to render embedded fonts (unlike SVG or PDF)
- Flexibility: endless scalability, easy to change size and add effects like text-shadow
- Accessibility: ligatures can allow text versions of the images which are visible to search engine spiders
- Workflow Efficiency: save time without having to generate sprites, type in a word and the image is ready

### CONS

- Single design for different sizes
- Single color (though it is easy to change color and color emoji may remedy this)

### FONT EFFECTS

- Any CSS effect that can be applied to fonts (text-properties)
- [Google font effects (beta)](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started)

### ASSIGNMENT

Create a bio page for yourself that uses font icons for the following: 
- describe your interests or items that you own
- buttons that link to your body of portfolio work
- your location, where youâ€™ve traveled or where you want to travel
- social media icons

You are not limited to only using icon fonts, but try to avoid using image files other than your bio photo.
